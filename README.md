# projects
The same project, same feature, created each time with different technologies and approach. 
Just a simple series of case studies project.

This is the parent Repository, all the variations of this all will be placed inside SubModules of this repo (submodules are basically like nested repos), this way it's possible to download the entire projects collection, or the one for the stack you're interested in.
Personally, this README file is considered like a BEHAVIOR CONTRACT (sort of interface, except the fact that i'm writing and implementing it). 
I'm creating a list of key feature, my app needs to have, and next i'll be working on these only.
 
 These feature are based on the the BASIC functions and approach, any app needs to have in the modern day. 
 From dbAccess to security controls, to style coding ecc ecc.
 
The app will have the following feature:
Login or Register
  Access usersList, and modify it (only if you are logged and an administrator)
  access Personal ToDoList
  access shared ChatRoom
  Create a chatroom and invite another app User;
  
I do not own any of the technologies used in this project.
This is intended for recreational and study use only, i reccomend to not use it for production.
I decline any responsability on how this code will be used.
